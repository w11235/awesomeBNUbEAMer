# awesomeBNUbEAMer

The **awesomeBNUbEAMer** is an open project for creating tidy and clean BNU styled beamer templates. 
Personally, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND guys major in *Science & Techs* to use LaTeX and beamer to produce your presentation slides.

And GET RID OF POWERPOINT!

## How to Use

### In Terminal
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/awesomeBNUbEAMer
xelatex main.tex && biber main && xelatex main.tex && xelatex main.tex
```
### Overleaf

## LaTeX & Beamer

LaTeX is an amazing typesetting system converting commands into stylished articles/books/slides and etc. LaTeX is a typesetting system rather than a programming language, and sometimes the language may look weird.

For more details in LaTeX usage, you may want to Google search `LaTeX Tutorial`.

Beamer is a document class in LaTeX system. A lot of extensions could be built upon beamer.

## Join In & Support

Be free join in this project! All you need may be 15 mins only to get familiar with the LaTeX command system.

We need your support for more decent slides!
